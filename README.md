# Python for Those Who Cannot Even

*A Reluctant Guide to a Language That Uses Whitespace as Syntax*

## About This Book

Look, we're all here for different reasons. Maybe your boss told you to learn Python. Maybe you lost a bet. Maybe you just hate yourself a little bit. Whatever brought you here, welcome to the support group.

This book teaches Python to people who:
- Already know how to program in a real language (one with curly braces)
- Miss semicolons like old friends who moved away
- Think significant whitespace is what happens when your spacebar gets stuck
- Would rather be writing Ruby but the job market said "lol no"
